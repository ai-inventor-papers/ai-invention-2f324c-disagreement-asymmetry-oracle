<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for related-work positioning and how this field frames a genuinely novel contribution.

<writing_register>
Write in the register of the field's best papers (the passages you collect in the STYLE EXEMPLARS todo), not in the register of a language
model. Four things are measured on the finished draft, and a draft outside them is sent back with
the numbers:
- Never use: delve, underscore, showcase, intricate, pivotal, realm, commendable, meticulous, tapestry, garner, multifaceted, it is worth noting, plays a crucial role, not only ... but also. These are 10 to 30 times more frequent in machine-written abstracts than in
  human ones, and reviewers read them as such.
- Em dashes: at most 3 per 1,000 words. Use a comma, a colon or a full stop.
- Sentence rhythm: mix short and long sentences. An interquartile range of sentence length under
  8 words reads as machine-written.
- Hedging: at most 15 hedges (may, likely, suggests, appears) per 1,000
  words. State what the evidence supports plainly; hedge where it is thin, not everywhere.
Style never changes substance: numbers, claims, citations and figure markers stay exactly as the
evidence gives them. The user's original request (delivered as a separate message) overrides all
of this wherever the two conflict.

<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Disagreement Asymmetry Oracle
hypothesis: >-
  When two dissimilar classifiers disagree on sentiment labels, the direction of their disagreement systematically predicts
  which model is correct: the simpler model (e.g., logistic regression) is more likely right when it predicts the majority
  class, while the more complex model (e.g., random forest) is more likely right when it predicts the minority class. This
  asymmetry emerges from the bias-variance tradeoff: simple models are biased toward the majority and resist overfitting to
  noise, while complex models capture genuine minority-class signals but overfit to noise within the majority class.
motivation: >-
  Sentiment classification on small datasets is notoriously unstable — models overfit, benchmarks are noisy, and it is unclear
  which model to trust when they disagree. Current work measures the MAGNITUDE of disagreement (e.g., trust scores, prediction
  entropy) but ignores the DIRECTION. If the direction carries a systematic signal about which model is correct, this would
  provide a free, model-agnostic diagnostic for label quality and a path to building better ensembles without additional training
  data. It also reveals a fundamental property of the bias-variance tradeoff that has not been measured: that the two sides
  of a disagreement are not symmetric.
assumptions:
- >-
  The two classifiers have sufficiently different inductive biases (e.g., linear vs. tree-based) so that their errors are
  not perfectly correlated.
- >-
  The dataset contains both genuine minority-class signals and noise that complex models overfit to.
- >-
  The majority-class bias of simple models and the minority-class sensitivity of complex models hold for sentiment data on
  small samples.
- >-
  The direction of disagreement is not purely random but reflects systematic structural properties of the data.
investigation_approach: >-
  Train two dissimilar baselines (logistic regression with TF-IDF features and a random forest with character n-gram features)
  on small sentiment datasets (e.g., subset of IMDB, SST-2, or Twitter sentiment data with 100-1000 samples). On the held-out
  test set, identify all samples where the two models disagree. For each disagreement, record: (1) which model predicts which
  class, (2) the true label, (3) the class balance of the dataset. Test whether the direction of disagreement (simple model
  says positive vs. negative) predicts correctness at a rate significantly above chance. Quantify the asymmetry as a function
  of dataset size, class imbalance, and label noise level. Compare against baselines: random guessing on disagreements, confidence-based
  selection, and the trust score method.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED: The direction of disagreement predicts the correct label with accuracy significantly above 50% (e.g., >60% on
  disagreement samples), and this effect is statistically significant (p < 0.01) across multiple datasets and random seeds.
  The asymmetry is predictable from dataset properties (class balance, noise level) and improves ensemble performance over
  voting or confidence-based selection. DISCONFIRMED: The direction of disagreement is random (accuracy ~50%), or the effect
  disappears when controlling for confidence scores, suggesting it is not a distinct signal.
related_works:
- >-
  Jiang et al. (NIPS 2018) 'To Trust Or Not To Trust A Classifier': Proposes a trust score based on agreement between a classifier
  and a nearest-neighbor classifier. Measures agreement MAGNITUDE, not disagreement DIRECTION. Does not study which model
  is correct when they disagree.
- >-
  Uma et al. (JAIR 2021) 'Learning from Disagreement: A Survey': Reviews methods for handling annotator disagreement in training
  data. Focuses on human-to-human disagreement, not inter-model disagreement direction as a diagnostic.
- >-
  Freestone et al. (2021) 'Pervasive Label Errors in Test Sets': Shows that label errors in benchmarks destabilize results.
  Does not propose using inter-model disagreement direction to detect which labels are wrong.
- >-
  Ensemble diversity literature (e.g., Kuncheva 2006): Studies how diversity among ensemble members improves performance,
  but does not examine directional asymmetry of individual disagreements.
- >-
  Label noise detection methods (e.g., FINE, MentorNet): Use model confidence and loss patterns to detect noisy labels, but
  do not leverage directional disagreement between dissimilar models as a signal.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis draws from three distant fields: (1) EPIDEMIOLOGY — the concept of an 'error reproduction number' analogous
  to R0, where errors propagate through similar samples; the direction of disagreement is like tracking which 'strain' of
  error is spreading. (2) ECOLOGY — Shannon diversity indices measure community structure; here, the 'community' is the set
  of model predictions, and the direction of disagreement reveals the underlying 'species' composition of the data (signal
  vs. noise). (3) STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY — the bias-variance tradeoff predicts that simple models err in one direction
  (toward the mean) and complex models in another (toward noise), creating a measurable asymmetry that has never been formalized
  as a diagnostic tool.
terms:
- term: Disagreement Asymmetry
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where the direction of disagreement between two classifiers (Model A says class X while Model B says class
    Y, versus the reverse) carries systematic information about which prediction is correct.
- term: Inductive Bias
  definition: >-
    The set of assumptions a learning algorithm uses to predict outputs for inputs it has not encountered. Simple models (e.g.,
    logistic regression) have strong inductive biases toward linear decision boundaries; complex models (e.g., random forests)
    have weaker biases and can fit more complex patterns.
- term: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
  definition: >-
    The decomposition of prediction error into bias (error from erroneous assumptions) and variance (error from sensitivity
    to fluctuations in training data). Simple models have high bias, low variance; complex models have low bias, high variance.
- term: Trust Score
  definition: >-
    A metric proposed by Jiang et al. (2018) that measures the agreement between a classifier and a nearest-neighbor classifier
    to assess prediction reliability. It measures agreement magnitude, not disagreement direction.
- term: Disagreement Oracle
  definition: >-
    A meta-model or rule that uses the pattern of disagreement between two base classifiers to predict which classifier's
    output is correct on a given sample.
summary: >-
  When two dissimilar sentiment classifiers disagree, the direction of their disagreement systematically predicts which one
  is correct, revealing a measurable asymmetry rooted in the bias-variance tradeoff that has never been studied as a diagnostic
  tool.

type: dataset
title: Sentiment Datasets for Disagreement Asymmetry
summary: >-
  This artifact provides three curated sentiment classification datasets standardized to the exp_sel_data_out JSON schema,
  ready for testing the disagreement asymmetry hypothesis. The datasets span three domains: (1) SST-2 (67,349 examples): binary
  sentiment labels on movie review sentences from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, with 44% negative / 56% positive distribution.
  (2) IMDB (25,000 examples): binary sentiment labels on full movie reviews, perfectly balanced at 50/50. (3) Twitter Financial
  News (3,365 examples): binary sentiment (bearish/bullish) on finance-related tweets, with 43% bearish / 57% bullish distribution.
  Each example contains: input (raw text), output (binary label as string '0' or '1'), and rich metadata including fold assignment
  (5-fold CV), task type, number of classes, row index, domain label, and unique example ID. Total: 95,714 examples across
  3 datasets. All datasets have verified provenance (HuggingFace Hub, established benchmarks with 100K+ downloads), clear
  documentation, and research-permissive licenses. Baseline comparison on SST-2 shows Logistic Regression (87.05% accuracy)
  outperforms Naive Bayes (85.56% accuracy) with TF-IDF features. The full_data_out.json (65MB) is under the 100MB file size
  limit. Mini (9 examples) and preview (9 truncated examples) variants are provided for quick inspection.

title: Disagreement Direction Test for Sentiment
summary: >-
  This artifact implements the Disagreement Direction Test for Sentiment Classification. It trains two models — a simple TF-IDF
  + Logistic Regression and a complex character n-gram + RandomForest — on SST-2 and IMDB datasets across 240 configurations
  (4 sample sizes × 3 imbalance ratios × 10 seeds × 2 datasets). On each test set, it identifies samples where the models
  disagree and evaluates a directional rule (trust the simple model when it predicts the majority class, otherwise trust the
  complex model) against three baselines: random guessing, confidence-based selection (pick the model with higher predicted
  probability), and trust-score proxy (k-NN agreement in TF-IDF space). Statistical significance is assessed via binomial
  tests and McNemar's tests. Results: 217 of 240 configurations produced disagreements (3,711 total). Mean directional rule
  accuracy = 0.419, underperforming confidence baseline (0.544) and trust score baseline (0.531), suggesting the directional
  hypothesis does not hold on sentiment classification. The output includes per-configuration metrics, an ablation table,
  and full disagreement records in exp_gen_sol_out schema format.

</data_files>

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib, aii-web-tools.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. STYLE EXEMPLARS: Decide which field or fields this paper belongs to; a paper spanning two
fields takes exemplars from both. If `./style_exemplars.md` already exists in your workspace
(a previous iteration wrote it), read it and skip the search. Otherwise use the aii-web-tools
skill's scholarly search (OpenAlex) to find the best-cited open-access papers of the last five
years closest to this paper, fetch four or five of them through the skill's fetch tool (arXiv HTML
or PDF), and copy VERBATIM into `./style_exemplars.md`, each passage headed by the paper's
title, year and URL: the abstract, the first paragraph of the introduction, one results paragraph
that reports numbers, and one discussion or limitations paragraph. Read the file once as a whole
and put one line at its top on how those papers handle sentence length, hedging, first person and
citation density. Write the paper in that register. Their sentences and their content are never
reused; they are exemplars of style, not sources.
TODO 4. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 5. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Do NOT emit your structured output when the draft is done — TODO 6 is a
separate revision pass that runs over the finished draft first.
TODO 6. REVISION PASS — start this ONLY once TODO 5's draft is complete, and treat it as a distinct
pass over the finished text rather than something folded into the writing. Read
`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md` in the aii-paper-writing skill's own directory and apply every item to the
full draft.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done at the same time. The defects that
checklist targets — prose denser than the field needs, an abstract dumped full of numbers, sections
that leak into one another, a Figure 1 that shows a side result instead of the main idea, close
prior work that only the draft's FINAL vocabulary would have surfaced, a study of N things that
plots eight of them, section names that mean nothing to someone who has not read the section,
implementation filenames cited in the prose, numbers that disagree between the abstract, the text
and the tables — are all invisible while drafting, because you are holding your intent rather than
the text. Every one is obvious to the first outside reader.

Work the items one at a time against the ACTUAL text, not from memory of what you meant to write.
For each item, either fix the draft or state in one line why it already holds. The checklist's
consistency section is several SEPARATE sweeps of the whole paper, one concern per sweep — run them
that way, and repeat any sweep that produced an edit, since a fix in one place routinely breaks
agreement somewhere else. Expect this pass to change the draft; one that produces no edits was not
really run.

Only when the checklist is fully worked through, emit the structured JSON — that is your ONLY
output. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate image/figure files at any point.

The agent loaded the **aii-paper-writing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-paper-writing
description: "Writes the PROSE of an AI research paper: abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, discussion and conclusion, with a page budget, the 5-paragraph intro pattern, writing-quality rules, inline [FIGURE:fig_id] markers plus a structured figures array, and a MANDATORY REVISION_CHECKLIST.md pass over every finished draft. Use whenever a paper, abstract, section, or full write-up is being drafted or rewritten for a venue such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR or ACL. Triggers: write a paper, paper structure, abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, contributions, figure caption and placement, revision pass, academic prose. NOT for: assembling or compiling .tex (use aii-paper-to-latex), rendering the figure image files (aii-data-fig-gen, aii-concept-fig-gen), fetching BibTeX (use aii-semscholar-bib), or critiquing a finished draft's logic (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## MANDATORY: the final revision pass

**`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`, in this skill's own directory, MUST be read and
applied to every finished draft, always, as a separate pass after the writing
is done.** It is not optional, not conditional on how the draft looks, and not
something to fold into the writing itself.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done in one pass. The
defects that checklist targets — dense prose, a number-dumped abstract, sections
that leak into each other, a Figure 1 that shows a side result, prior work the
final vocabulary would have found, results mentioned but never plotted,
inconsistencies between abstract and tables — are all invisible while drafting,
because the author is holding the intent rather than the text. Every one of them
is obvious to the first outside reader. Reading the checklist before writing
does not substitute: the pass has to run against a finished draft.

So the order is always: write the complete draft → read `REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`
→ work its items against the full text, fixing as you go → only then emit the
output.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: "Fetches real BibTeX entries in one batch from Semantic Scholar by DOI, ArXiv ID or title via aii_semscholar_bib__fetch, normalises citation keys to AuthorYYYY, injects DOIs, and writes the result into references.bib, with a mandatory web-search fallback for anything not found. ALWAYS use whenever a bibliography, reference list or .bib file is being built or extended, and whenever a citation needs a verified entry instead of an invented one — never hand-write BibTeX first. Triggers: bibliography, references.bib, bibtex, citation key, DOI, arXiv id, Semantic Scholar, reference list, cite these papers, natbib entries. NOT for: writing the text around the citations (use aii-paper-writing), running bibtex and compiling (use aii-paper-to-latex), judging whether cited work supports the claims (use amg-paper-verification), or open-ended literature search and PDF mining (use aii-web-tools)."
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

---

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[

  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"

---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
