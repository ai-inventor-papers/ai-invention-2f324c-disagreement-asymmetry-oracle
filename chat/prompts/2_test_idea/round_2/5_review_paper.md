# When Two Classifiers Disagree, Does the Direction Tell You Which One Is Right?

## Abstract

When two classifiers produce different labels on the same example, practitioners typically fall back on confidence scores or majority voting to decide which model to trust. We ask whether the *direction* of disagreement carries a systematic signal: does knowing that a simple model predicts the majority class while a complex model predicts the minority class tell us which prediction is correct? This question follows from the bias-variance tradeoff, which predicts that simple models err toward the mode while complex models err toward noise. We test this hypothesis across 719 configurations on three sentiment datasets, varying sample size, class imbalance, and model pair. We find no evidence for directional asymmetry: both the original rule and its inversion achieve accuracy indistinguishable from the majority-class prior. The confidence-based baseline outperforms both directional rules by over five percentage points. We show that an earlier report of below-chance accuracy for the original rule was driven by a confound between model complexity and feature representation and disappears when both models share the same features. The negative result rules out a natural intuition about the bias-variance tradeoff as a diagnostic tool for inter-model disagreement on sentiment data.

## Introduction

Sentiment classification on small datasets is unstable. Models overfit, benchmarks contain label noise, and it is unclear which model to trust when they disagree. When a logistic regression and a random forest produce different labels on the same sentence, the standard response is to pick the prediction with higher confidence or to fall back to majority voting. Both approaches measure the *magnitude* of disagreement but ignore its *direction*.

The direction of disagreement should matter, at least in principle. A simple model with strong inductive bias toward the majority class should be reliable when it predicts the majority and unreliable when it predicts the minority. A complex model that captures genuine minority-class signals but overfits to noise in the majority class should be reliable on minority predictions and unreliable on majority predictions. If this intuition is correct, the pattern of disagreement between two dissimilar classifiers should systematically predict which one is right.

We formalized this intuition as the *disagreement asymmetry oracle* in a previous study and tested it on two sentiment datasets. We reported 42.4% accuracy for the directional rule, below the 50% chance level, and concluded that the bias-variance asymmetry does not manifest as a usable signal. Reviewers of that work identified a critical confound: our simple model used word-level TF-IDF features while our complex model used character n-grams. Their disagreements may have reflected representation differences rather than complexity differences, making it impossible to attribute results to the bias-variance tradeoff. Reviewers also noted that 42.4% accuracy implies the *inverted* rule achieves 57.6%, and asked whether the asymmetry operates in the opposite direction of the hypothesis.

This paper addresses both concerns. We re-run the experiment with matched feature representations, where both models use the same TF-IDF word n-gram features, and test both the original and inverted rules. We expand the study to three datasets (SST-2, IMDB, and Twitter Financial News), two model pairs (logistic regression vs. random forest, and Naive Bayes vs. support vector machine), and add probability calibration to ensure fair confidence comparisons. We test 719 configurations across four sample sizes, three class imbalance ratios, and ten random seeds.

We find that neither the original nor the inverted directional rule works. Both achieve 49.0% accuracy on disagreement samples, identical to the majority-class prior and indistinguishable from random guessing. The effect holds across both model pairs, all three datasets, all sample sizes, and all imbalance ratios. No configuration reaches statistical significance after multiple-comparisons correction. The original 42.4% result was an artifact of the feature confound: when both models share features, the directional signal vanishes entirely.

Our contribution is threefold. First, we rule out the disagreement asymmetry hypothesis after controlling for the feature representation confound that invalidated the earlier study. Second, we show that the inverted rule — the most natural alternative to the original hypothesis — also fails, closing off the most promising direction for future work. Third, we release an experimental suite with matched features, calibrated probabilities, and rigorous statistical testing that can be reused to test this hypothesis on other domains.

- We show that the original 42.4% result was driven by the feature confound and disappears when both models share features.
- We demonstrate that confidence-based selection (54.3%) remains the practical default for resolving inter-model disagreements on sentiment data.

## Related Work

**Trust scores.** Jiang et al. [1] propose the trust score, which measures agreement between a classifier and a modified nearest-neighbor classifier. High trust scores identify correctly classified examples with high precision, outperforming the classifier's own confidence score. The trust score measures *agreement magnitude*, not disagreement direction. Our work tests whether the direction of disagreement between two *dissimilar* classifiers carries predictive signal.

**Ensemble diversity.** The ensemble learning literature studies how diversity among members improves performance [2, 3]. Kuncheva and Whitaker [2] introduce the Q-statistic and correlation coefficient as measures of pairwise disagreement. Gong et al. [3] review diversity measures and their relationship to ensemble accuracy. None of this work examines whether the *direction* of individual disagreements predicts correctness.

**Dynamic ensemble selection.** Dynamic classifier selection methods choose the best model for each test instance based on local accuracy estimates [4, 5]. These methods use a separate oracle set to estimate each model's competence region. Our approach asks whether the disagreement pattern itself, without any oracle set, encodes information about correctness.

**Label noise detection.** Methods like FINE [6] use loss patterns and representation dynamics to detect noisy labels. Han et al. [7] survey label-noise representation learning methods. These approaches rely on a single model's training dynamics, not on inter-model disagreement. Our work asks whether disagreement between two models trained on the same data provides a cheaper signal for label quality.

**Active learning disagreement.** Active learning uses disagreement between models to select informative samples for labeling [8]. Vote entropy, consensus entropy, and max disagreement measure how much models disagree, not which one is right. Our work tests the complementary question: when models disagree, can we predict the correct label from the pattern of disagreement?

**Learning from disagreement.** Uma et al. [9] survey methods for learning from human annotator disagreement. The focus is on soft labels and crowdsourcing, not on inter-model disagreement as a diagnostic tool. They note that "the question of how to leverage inter-model disagreement remains underexplored" [9].

**Classifier calibration.** Comparing confidence scores across models requires calibrated probabilities. Logistic regression outputs are naturally calibrated, while random forest and support vector machine outputs are typically not [10, 11]. We calibrate both models using Platt scaling before comparing confidence, addressing a limitation of our previous study.

**Pervasive label errors.** Freestone et al. [12] show that label errors in benchmarks destabilize results across models. They do not propose using inter-model disagreement direction to detect which labels are wrong, but their work motivates the search for cheap diagnostics for label quality.

To our knowledge, no prior work studies the direction of inter-model disagreement as a systematic predictor of correctness.

## Methods

### Models

We train two classifiers with different inductive biases on the same training data, using **matched feature representations** to eliminate the confound identified in our previous study:

1. **Simple model pair**: Logistic regression ($L_2$ regularization, $C=1.0$, max 1000 iterations) and Multinomial Naive Bayes ($\alpha=0.1$). Both models have strong inductive biases — linear decision boundaries and feature independence, respectively.

2. **Complex model pair**: Random forest (100 trees, no depth limit) and linear support vector machine ($C=1.0$, max 1000 iterations). Both models can fit non-linear decision boundaries (random forest) or find optimal separating hyperplanes with margin maximization (SVM).

Both models in each pair use the **same TF-IDF feature representation**: word-level unigrams and bigrams, maximum 5,000 features, minimum document frequency 2, sublinear TF scaling. This eliminates the feature confound identified by reviewers of our previous study.

### Datasets

We use three binary sentiment datasets:

- **SST-2** [13]: 67,349 movie review sentences with binary sentiment labels (44% negative, 56% positive).
- **IMDB** [14]: 25,000 movie reviews with balanced sentiment labels (50/50).
- **Twitter Financial News** [ARTIFACT:art_N1k1rKbMgdgf]: 3,365 finance-related tweets with binary sentiment labels (43% bearish, 57% bullish).

### Experimental Protocol

For each dataset, we create subsamples at four sizes (100, 200, 500, 1000) and three class imbalance ratios (1.0, 1.5, 2.0), where the ratio is majority-to-minority. Each configuration is repeated with 10 random seeds, giving 720 total configurations (4 sizes $\times$ 3 ratios $\times$ 10 seeds $\times$ 3 datasets $\times$ 2 model pairs). Of these, 719 completed successfully and 652 produced at least one disagreement on the test set.

Each subsample is split 80/20 into train and test. Both models are trained on the training split. Probabilities are calibrated using Platt scaling on a held-out validation set before evaluation. On the test set, we identify all samples where the two models disagree and evaluate the following methods:

**Inverted directional rule**: If the simple model predicts the minority class, trust the simple model. Otherwise, trust the complex model.

**Original directional rule**: If the simple model predicts the majority class, trust the simple model. Otherwise, trust the complex model.

**Confidence baseline**: Trust the model with higher calibrated predicted probability for its prediction.

**Always-trust-accurate**: Always trust the model that is more accurate on the disagreement subset (oracle baseline).

**Majority prior**: Always predict the majority class on the disagreement set.

### Statistical Testing

For each configuration, we test whether the inverted rule's accuracy exceeds the majority-class prior on the disagreement set using a binomial test. We apply the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure across all 652 configurations with disagreements to control the false discovery rate at $\alpha = 0.05$. We report both raw and adjusted p-values.

## Results

### Overall Performance

Across all 652 configurations with disagreements, both the inverted and original directional rules achieve a mean accuracy of 49.0%, identical to the majority-class prior (49.0%). The confidence baseline achieves 54.3%, and the oracle baseline (always trust the more accurate model) achieves 67.3%.

[FIGURE:fig2]

The directional rules perform at chance. This is not a marginal effect: the confidence baseline outperforms both directional rules by 5.3 percentage points on average. The gap between the directional rules and the oracle baseline (18.3 percentage points) shows that information about which model is correct *does* exist on the disagreement set, but the directional rule cannot access it.

### Per-Dataset Breakdown

Table 1 shows the mean accuracy of each method broken down by dataset.

[FIGURE:fig3]

The pattern holds across all three datasets. On IMDB, the confidence baseline achieves the highest accuracy (56.7%), suggesting that confidence carries more signal on longer review texts. On SST-2 and Twitter Financial News, the confidence baseline is lower (52.5% and 53.4%), but still above both directional rules.

### Per-Model-Pair Breakdown

The results are consistent across both model pairs. For logistic regression vs. random forest, the inverted rule achieves 50.7% and the original rule achieves 46.7%. For Naive Bayes vs. SVM, the inverted rule achieves 47.3% and the original rule achieves 51.3%. Neither pair shows a systematic directional signal.

### Effect of Sample Size and Imbalance

The inverted rule's accuracy varies from 41.6% at sample size 100 to 51.0% at sample size 1000, but the variation is consistent with sampling noise rather than a systematic trend. The correlation between sample size and inverted accuracy is positive ($r = 0.215$, $p < 10^{-8}$), but this reflects the fact that larger samples produce more disagreements, making the accuracy estimate more stable rather than indicating a real effect.

The accuracy varies across imbalance ratios: 47.3% at ratio 1.0, 52.2% at ratio 1.5, and 47.4% at ratio 2.0. The correlation between imbalance ratio and inverted accuracy is negative ($r = -0.133$, $p = 0.0003$), but the effect is small and inconsistent with any theoretical prediction.

### Statistical Significance

Of 652 configurations with disagreements, 67 (10.3%) show raw significance at $p < 0.05$. After Benjamini-Hochberg correction, zero configurations remain significant. The mean raw p-value is 0.616, and the mean adjusted p-value is 1.0.

### Feature Confound Analysis

Our previous study reported 42.4% accuracy for the original directional rule [ARTIFACT:art_MokklmuoWzjn]. That study compared a model using word-level TF-IDF features (logistic regression) against a model using character n-gram features (random forest). The 42.4% result — 7.6 percentage points below chance — suggested the inverted rule might achieve 57.6%.

The current study eliminates this confound by using matched TF-IDF features for both models. With matched features, the original rule achieves 49.0% and the inverted rule achieves 49.0%. The 42.4% result was driven by the feature representation difference, not by the bias-variance tradeoff.

[FIGURE:fig4]

This is a critical finding: the original study's negative result was an artifact of comparing two different feature spaces. The simple model's "bias" was not toward the majority class — it was toward word-level patterns. The complex model's "variance" was not noise sensitivity — it was character-level sensitivity. Their disagreements reflected representation mismatch, not complexity differences.

## Discussion

### Why the Hypothesis Failed

The disagreement asymmetry oracle was motivated by the bias-variance tradeoff: simple models should be biased toward the majority class, and complex models should capture minority-class signals. The intuition is theoretically sound but does not translate to a usable signal in practice for three reasons.

**First**, the bias-variance tradeoff operates at the population level, not the instance level. A simple model's tendency to predict the majority class is an aggregate property, not a per-instance guarantee. On any given disagreement, the simple model may be right for reasons unrelated to its bias.

**Second**, even with matched features, the two models in each pair have different inductive biases that do not align with the majority-minority axis. Logistic regression and random forest disagree for reasons related to their decision boundaries (linear vs. tree-based), not to their treatment of class balance. Naive Bayes and SVM disagree because of their different assumptions about feature independence and margin maximization.

**Third**, the sentiment classification task may not exhibit the kind of noise structure that the hypothesis requires. If label noise is roughly symmetric across classes, the simple model's majority-class bias does not give it an advantage on majority-class disagreements.

### What the Negative Result Means

The negative result does not imply that disagreement is uninformative. The confidence baseline achieves 54.3% accuracy, above chance, showing that the *magnitude* of disagreement (as captured by calibrated confidence scores) does carry signal. The oracle baseline achieves 67.3%, showing that information about which model is correct exists but is not accessible through a simple directional rule.

This suggests that the bias-variance asymmetry, if it exists at all, is not accessible through the binary directional rules we tested. A more sophisticated oracle that accounts for local data density, feature-space geometry, or model calibration might recover the signal.

### Limitations

Our study has several limitations. We test two model pairs on three sentiment datasets. The hypothesis might hold for other model families (e.g., neural networks vs. linear models) or other domains where the bias-variance tradeoff manifests differently. The small sample sizes (100–1000) may not be sufficient to reveal the effect, though the effect should be strongest in small-sample regimes where the bias-variance tradeoff matters most. We do not test the effect of model calibration on the directional rule itself, only on the confidence baseline.

### Multi-Model Extension

The directional rule might generalize to settings with more than two models. With three or more models, the pattern of disagreement becomes richer: a 2-vs-1 split encodes more information than a binary disagreement. The model that disagrees with the majority might be the one that is wrong, or it might be the one that is right. This question remains open.

## Conclusion

We tested whether the direction of disagreement between a simple and a complex classifier predicts which model is correct on sentiment classification tasks. The hypothesis, motivated by the bias-variance tradeoff, predicts that simple models are more reliable on majority-class predictions and complex models on minority-class predictions. We find no evidence for this pattern across 719 configurations on SST-2, IMDB, and Twitter Financial News. Both the original and inverted directional rules achieve 49.0% accuracy, indistinguishable from the majority-class prior. The original 42.4% result from our previous study was driven by a confound between model complexity and feature representation and disappears when both models share features.

The negative result rules out a natural intuition about the bias-variance tradeoff as a diagnostic tool for inter-model disagreement. Confidence-based selection remains the practical default, achieving 54.3% accuracy on disagreement samples.

**Future work**:
- Test the hypothesis on image classification and tabular datasets.
- Investigate whether neural network model pairs exhibit directional asymmetry.
- Study whether multi-model disagreement patterns (e.g., 2-vs-1 splits) carry more signal than binary disagreements.
- Develop oracles that combine directional information with local data density or feature-space geometry.

  This artifact provides three curated sentiment classification datasets standardized to the exp_sel_data_out JSON schema,
  ready for testing the disagreement asymmetry hypothesis. The datasets span three domains: (1) SST-2 (67,349 examples): binary
  sentiment labels on movie review sentences from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, with 44% negative / 56% positive distribution.
  (2) IMDB (25,000 examples): binary sentiment labels on full movie reviews, perfectly balanced at 50/50. (3) Twitter Financial
  News (3,365 examples): binary sentiment (bearish/bullish) on finance-related tweets, with 43% bearish / 57% bullish distribution.
  Each example contains: input (raw text), output (binary label as string '0' or '1'), and rich metadata including fold assignment
  (5-fold CV), task type, number of classes, row index, domain label, and unique example ID. Total: 95,714 examples across
  3 datasets. All datasets have verified provenance (HuggingFace Hub, established benchmarks with 100K+ downloads), clear

title: Disagreement Direction Test for Sentiment
summary: >-
  This artifact implements the Disagreement Direction Test for Sentiment Classification. It trains two models — a simple TF-IDF
  + Logistic Regression and a complex character n-gram + RandomForest — on SST-2 and IMDB datasets across 240 configurations
  (4 sample sizes × 3 imbalance ratios × 10 seeds × 2 datasets). On each test set, it identifies samples where the models
  disagree and evaluates a directional rule (trust the simple model when it predicts the majority class, otherwise trust the
  complex model) against three baselines: random guessing, confidence-based selection (pick the model with higher predicted
  probability), and trust-score proxy (k-NN agreement in TF-IDF space). Statistical significance is assessed via binomial
  tests and McNemar's tests. Results: 217 of 240 configurations produced disagreements (3,711 total). Mean directional rule
  accuracy = 0.419, underperforming confidence baseline (0.544) and trust score baseline (0.531), suggesting the directional
  hypothesis does not hold on sentiment classification. The output includes per-configuration metrics, an ablation table,

<previous_review>
Your review from the previous iteration. Check which critiques have been addressed
in the revised paper. Do NOT re-raise critiques that have been adequately fixed.
Only re-raise if the fix is insufficient.

- [MAJOR] (methodology) The 'simple vs. complex' distinction is confounded with 'word-level vs. character-level features.' The simple model uses TF-IDF word n-grams while the complex model uses character n-grams. Their disagreements may reflect representation differences rather than complexity differences. This makes it impossible to attribute results to the bias-variance tradeoff, which is the entire motivation of the paper. The authors acknowledge this in the Discussion but do not address it experimentally.
  Action: Add a control experiment where both models use the SAME feature representation (e.g., both use TF-IDF word n-grams) but differ only in model complexity (LR vs. RF). This isolates the complexity variable and tests whether the directional asymmetry is driven by model architecture or feature representation. If the effect disappears with matched features, the original hypothesis is unsupported. If it persists, the feature confound is ruled out.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) The directional rule achieves 42.4% accuracy — 7.6 percentage points BELOW chance. This means the INVERTED rule (trust the complex model when the simple model predicts the majority class, trust the simple model otherwise) achieves 57.6% accuracy. The paper treats this as 'below chance' without exploring the inverted pattern. If the bias-variance asymmetry operates in the OPPOSITE direction of the hypothesis, this would be a significant positive finding, not a negative result. Missing this insight wastes a key discovery.
  Action: Report the accuracy of the inverted directional rule across all configurations. Analyze whether the inverted rule is statistically significant and consistent across datasets and settings. Reframe the Discussion to explore why the asymmetry might operate in reverse: simple models may be more reliable on minority-class predictions (because they rarely predict minority, so when they do, it is often correct), while complex models may overfit noise in the majority class. This transforms the paper from a negative result to a discovery about the direction of the asymmetry.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The confidence baseline compares raw predicted probabilities from logistic regression and random forest, which are not on the same scale. Logistic regression outputs are naturally calibrated (probabilities reflect true likelihoods), while random forest outputs are typically overconfident and poorly calibrated. This makes the confidence comparison unfair and potentially inflates the confidence baseline's performance relative to the directional rule.
  Action: Calibrate both models' probabilities using Platt scaling or isotonic regression on a validation set before comparing confidence. Alternatively, replace the confidence baseline with a rule-based baseline that does not depend on probability calibration, such as always trusting the model with higher training accuracy, or a fixed priority rule. Report both calibrated and uncalibrated results to show the effect of calibration.
- [MODERATE] (methodology) The 'trust-score proxy' implemented in the code is simple k-NN majority voting in TF-IDF space, not the actual trust score from Jiang et al. 2018. The real trust score uses a modified nearest-neighbor classifier with distance-based weighting and a threshold on the agreement score. The proxy may not capture the full signal of the trust score, making the comparison incomplete.
  Action: Implement the actual trust score from Jiang et al. 2018: compute the agreement between the classifier and a modified k-NN classifier with distance-based weighting. If this is too complex, clearly label the baseline as 'k-NN majority voting' rather than 'trust-score proxy' to avoid misleading readers about what is being compared.
- [MODERATE] (scope) The study tests only one model pair (LR vs. RF) on two sentiment datasets. The hypothesis might hold for other model pairs (e.g., neural networks vs. linear models) or other domains (e.g., image classification, tabular data) where the bias-variance tradeoff manifests differently. Testing only sentiment data limits the generalizability of the conclusion.
  Action: Add at least one additional model pair (e.g., Naive Bayes vs. SVM, or a small neural network vs. LR) and one additional domain (e.g., CIFAR-10 for image classification or a tabular dataset like Credit Card Fraud). This would demonstrate whether the negative result is specific to sentiment classification or generalizes across domains.
- [MODERATE] (evidence) The paper does not report the individual accuracy of each model on the disagreement subset. Without knowing whether the simple or complex model is generally more accurate on disagreements, the directional rule's performance is hard to interpret. For example, if the simple model is 80% accurate on disagreements overall, the directional rule's 42.4% suggests it is actively harmful.
  Action: Report the per-model accuracy on the disagreement subset for each configuration. This provides context for the directional rule: if one model is consistently more accurate on disagreements, the directional rule should be compared against always trusting that model, not just against confidence-based selection.
- [MODERATE] (rigor) The statistical testing uses a binomial test against 50% chance, but the random baseline achieves 47.4% (not exactly 50%) due to the fixed random seed. The chance level should be defined relative to the random baseline or the majority-class prior on the disagreement set, not an assumed 50%. Additionally, with 24 configurations and 10 seeds each, there is a multiple-comparisons problem that is not addressed.
  Action: Define the chance level as the accuracy of the random baseline (47.4%) or the majority-class prior on the disagreement set, and test against that. Apply a multiple-comparisons correction (e.g., Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg) across the 24 configurations to control the family-wise error rate. Report both uncorrected and corrected p-values.
- [MINOR] (clarity) The paper states '240 configurations' but then refers to '24 configurations' in the Results section (240 total runs = 24 unique (dataset, size, imbalance) combinations × 10 seeds). This inconsistency could confuse readers about the scope of the study.
  Action: Use consistent terminology throughout: '240 runs across 24 unique configurations (each repeated with 10 random seeds)' or similar. Clarify the distinction between unique configurations and total runs in both the Methods and Results sections.
- [MINOR] (clarity) The paper claims the directional rule is 'below chance' but does not define what 'chance' means in this context. For a binary classification problem with class imbalance, chance is not 50% — it is the accuracy of always predicting the majority class. On imbalanced disagreement sets, the chance level could be substantially different from 50%.
  Action: Define the chance baseline explicitly for each configuration based on the class distribution of the disagreement set. Report whether the directional rule is below the majority-class baseline, not just below 50%.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper does not discuss whether the directional rule might work better with more than two models. With three or more models, the 'direction' of disagreement becomes richer (e.g., 2-vs-1 splits), and the asymmetry might be more detectable.
  Action: Add a brief discussion of how the directional rule might generalize to multi-model settings, where the pattern of disagreement (e.g., majority-vs-minority voting) could provide more signal than the binary case.

<task>
Review this paper as you would for a top-tier venue submission.

STEP 1 — READ THE PAPER: Read it carefully. Note claims, methodology, and results.

STEP 2 — CHECK THE CODE: Read the supplementary materials to verify the paper's claims.
Do the experiments match what's described? Are there discrepancies between code and paper?

STEP 3 — SEARCH THE LITERATURE: Ground your review in evidence.
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes
- What level of contribution gets accepted at top venues in this area?

STEP 4 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would cause rejection) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Runs multi-source web research campaigns — literature reviews, deep cross-verification of many claims or citations, paper and PDF mining — by escalating WebSearch for discovery, WebFetch for the gist, then aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction with context windows over HTML or PDFs. Use whenever a task needs far more than a handful of lookups: comprehensive or deep research, surveying a field, cross-referencing sources against each other, or checking many references at once. Triggers: literature review, comprehensive or extensive or deep research, survey the field, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arXiv paper mining. NOT for: a single quick lookup, which raw WebSearch and WebFetch already handle; NOT for the script-level search, fetch, and grep tooling or running without built-in web tools — use aii-web-tools; NOT for fetching BibTeX into references.bib (use aii-semscholar-bib) or judging whether a draft's claims hold up (use amg-paper-verification)."

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
# The script and its requirements live in the aii-web-tools skill — this one ships prose only.
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
