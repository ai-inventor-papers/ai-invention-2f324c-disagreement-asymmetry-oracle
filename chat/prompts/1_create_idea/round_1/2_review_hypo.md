kind: hypothesis
title: Disagreement Asymmetry Oracle
hypothesis: >-
  When two dissimilar classifiers disagree on sentiment labels, the direction of their disagreement systematically predicts
  which model is correct: the simpler model (e.g., logistic regression) is more likely right when it predicts the majority
  class, while the more complex model (e.g., random forest) is more likely right when it predicts the minority class. This
  asymmetry emerges from the bias-variance tradeoff: simple models are biased toward the majority and resist overfitting to
  noise, while complex models capture genuine minority-class signals but overfit to noise within the majority class.
motivation: >-
  Sentiment classification on small datasets is notoriously unstable — models overfit, benchmarks are noisy, and it is unclear
  which model to trust when they disagree. Current work measures the MAGNITUDE of disagreement (e.g., trust scores, prediction
  entropy) but ignores the DIRECTION. If the direction carries a systematic signal about which model is correct, this would
  provide a free, model-agnostic diagnostic for label quality and a path to building better ensembles without additional training
  data. It also reveals a fundamental property of the bias-variance tradeoff that has not been measured: that the two sides
  of a disagreement are not symmetric.
assumptions:
- >-
  The two classifiers have sufficiently different inductive biases (e.g., linear vs. tree-based) so that their errors are
  not perfectly correlated.
- >-
  The dataset contains both genuine minority-class signals and noise that complex models overfit to.
- >-
  The majority-class bias of simple models and the minority-class sensitivity of complex models hold for sentiment data on
  small samples.
- >-
  The direction of disagreement is not purely random but reflects systematic structural properties of the data.
investigation_approach: >-
  Train two dissimilar baselines (logistic regression with TF-IDF features and a random forest with character n-gram features)
  on small sentiment datasets (e.g., subset of IMDB, SST-2, or Twitter sentiment data with 100-1000 samples). On the held-out
  test set, identify all samples where the two models disagree. For each disagreement, record: (1) which model predicts which
  class, (2) the true label, (3) the class balance of the dataset. Test whether the direction of disagreement (simple model
  says positive vs. negative) predicts correctness at a rate significantly above chance. Quantify the asymmetry as a function
  of dataset size, class imbalance, and label noise level. Compare against baselines: random guessing on disagreements, confidence-based
  selection, and the trust score method.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED: The direction of disagreement predicts the correct label with accuracy significantly above 50% (e.g., >60% on
  disagreement samples), and this effect is statistically significant (p < 0.01) across multiple datasets and random seeds.
  The asymmetry is predictable from dataset properties (class balance, noise level) and improves ensemble performance over
  voting or confidence-based selection. DISCONFIRMED: The direction of disagreement is random (accuracy ~50%), or the effect
  disappears when controlling for confidence scores, suggesting it is not a distinct signal.
related_works:
- >-
  Jiang et al. (NIPS 2018) 'To Trust Or Not To Trust A Classifier': Proposes a trust score based on agreement between a classifier
  and a nearest-neighbor classifier. Measures agreement MAGNITUDE, not disagreement DIRECTION. Does not study which model
  is correct when they disagree.
- >-
  Uma et al. (JAIR 2021) 'Learning from Disagreement: A Survey': Reviews methods for handling annotator disagreement in training
  data. Focuses on human-to-human disagreement, not inter-model disagreement direction as a diagnostic.
- >-
  Freestone et al. (2021) 'Pervasive Label Errors in Test Sets': Shows that label errors in benchmarks destabilize results.
  Does not propose using inter-model disagreement direction to detect which labels are wrong.
- >-
  Ensemble diversity literature (e.g., Kuncheva 2006): Studies how diversity among ensemble members improves performance,
  but does not examine directional asymmetry of individual disagreements.
- >-
  Label noise detection methods (e.g., FINE, MentorNet): Use model confidence and loss patterns to detect noisy labels, but
  do not leverage directional disagreement between dissimilar models as a signal.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis draws from three distant fields: (1) EPIDEMIOLOGY — the concept of an 'error reproduction number' analogous
  to R0, where errors propagate through similar samples; the direction of disagreement is like tracking which 'strain' of
  error is spreading. (2) ECOLOGY — Shannon diversity indices measure community structure; here, the 'community' is the set
  of model predictions, and the direction of disagreement reveals the underlying 'species' composition of the data (signal
  vs. noise). (3) STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY — the bias-variance tradeoff predicts that simple models err in one direction
  (toward the mean) and complex models in another (toward noise), creating a measurable asymmetry that has never been formalized
  as a diagnostic tool.
terms:
- term: Disagreement Asymmetry
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where the direction of disagreement between two classifiers (Model A says class X while Model B says class
    Y, versus the reverse) carries systematic information about which prediction is correct.
- term: Inductive Bias
  definition: >-
    The set of assumptions a learning algorithm uses to predict outputs for inputs it has not encountered. Simple models (e.g.,
    logistic regression) have strong inductive biases toward linear decision boundaries; complex models (e.g., random forests)
    have weaker biases and can fit more complex patterns.
- term: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
  definition: >-
    The decomposition of prediction error into bias (error from erroneous assumptions) and variance (error from sensitivity
    to fluctuations in training data). Simple models have high bias, low variance; complex models have low bias, high variance.
- term: Trust Score
  definition: >-
    A metric proposed by Jiang et al. (2018) that measures the agreement between a classifier and a nearest-neighbor classifier
    to assess prediction reliability. It measures agreement magnitude, not disagreement direction.
- term: Disagreement Oracle
  definition: >-
    A meta-model or rule that uses the pattern of disagreement between two base classifiers to predict which classifier's
    output is correct on a given sample.
summary: >-
  When two dissimilar sentiment classifiers disagree, the direction of their disagreement systematically predicts which one
  is correct, revealing a measurable asymmetry rooted in the bias-variance tradeoff that has never been studied as a diagnostic
  tool.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Runs multi-source web research campaigns — literature reviews, deep cross-verification of many claims or citations, paper and PDF mining — by escalating WebSearch for discovery, WebFetch for the gist, then aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction with context windows over HTML or PDFs. Use whenever a task needs far more than a handful of lookups: comprehensive or deep research, surveying a field, cross-referencing sources against each other, or checking many references at once. Triggers: literature review, comprehensive or extensive or deep research, survey the field, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arXiv paper mining. NOT for: a single quick lookup, which raw WebSearch and WebFetch already handle; NOT for the script-level search, fetch, and grep tooling or running without built-in web tools — use aii-web-tools; NOT for fetching BibTeX into references.bib (use aii-semscholar-bib) or judging whether a draft's claims hold up (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
# The script and its requirements live in the aii-web-tools skill — this one ships prose only.
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
