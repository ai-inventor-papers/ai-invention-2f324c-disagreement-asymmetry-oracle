<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Implement and run any code-based experiment, compare method vs baselines.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one DATASET | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for methodology guidance
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.
</software_constraints>

<skills>
Skills are self-contained capabilities with instructions, context, and tools.

</skills>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Disagreement Asymmetry Oracle
hypothesis: >-
  When two dissimilar classifiers disagree on sentiment labels, the direction of their disagreement systematically predicts
  which model is correct: the simpler model (e.g., logistic regression) is more likely right when it predicts the majority
  class, while the more complex model (e.g., random forest) is more likely right when it predicts the minority class. This
  asymmetry emerges from the bias-variance tradeoff: simple models are biased toward the majority and resist overfitting to
  noise, while complex models capture genuine minority-class signals but overfit to noise within the majority class.
motivation: >-
  Sentiment classification on small datasets is notoriously unstable — models overfit, benchmarks are noisy, and it is unclear
  which model to trust when they disagree. Current work measures the MAGNITUDE of disagreement (e.g., trust scores, prediction
  entropy) but ignores the DIRECTION. If the direction carries a systematic signal about which model is correct, this would
  provide a free, model-agnostic diagnostic for label quality and a path to building better ensembles without additional training
  data. It also reveals a fundamental property of the bias-variance tradeoff that has not been measured: that the two sides
  of a disagreement are not symmetric.
assumptions:
- >-
  The two classifiers have sufficiently different inductive biases (e.g., linear vs. tree-based) so that their errors are
  not perfectly correlated.
- >-
  The dataset contains both genuine minority-class signals and noise that complex models overfit to.
- >-
  The majority-class bias of simple models and the minority-class sensitivity of complex models hold for sentiment data on
  small samples.
- >-
  The direction of disagreement is not purely random but reflects systematic structural properties of the data.
investigation_approach: >-
  Train two dissimilar baselines (logistic regression with TF-IDF features and a random forest with character n-gram features)
  on small sentiment datasets (e.g., subset of IMDB, SST-2, or Twitter sentiment data with 100-1000 samples). On the held-out
  test set, identify all samples where the two models disagree. For each disagreement, record: (1) which model predicts which
  class, (2) the true label, (3) the class balance of the dataset. Test whether the direction of disagreement (simple model
  says positive vs. negative) predicts correctness at a rate significantly above chance. Quantify the asymmetry as a function
  of dataset size, class imbalance, and label noise level. Compare against baselines: random guessing on disagreements, confidence-based
  selection, and the trust score method.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED: The direction of disagreement predicts the correct label with accuracy significantly above 50% (e.g., >60% on
  disagreement samples), and this effect is statistically significant (p < 0.01) across multiple datasets and random seeds.
  The asymmetry is predictable from dataset properties (class balance, noise level) and improves ensemble performance over
  voting or confidence-based selection. DISCONFIRMED: The direction of disagreement is random (accuracy ~50%), or the effect
  disappears when controlling for confidence scores, suggesting it is not a distinct signal.
related_works:
- >-
  Jiang et al. (NIPS 2018) 'To Trust Or Not To Trust A Classifier': Proposes a trust score based on agreement between a classifier
  and a nearest-neighbor classifier. Measures agreement MAGNITUDE, not disagreement DIRECTION. Does not study which model
  is correct when they disagree.
- >-
  Uma et al. (JAIR 2021) 'Learning from Disagreement: A Survey': Reviews methods for handling annotator disagreement in training
  data. Focuses on human-to-human disagreement, not inter-model disagreement direction as a diagnostic.
- >-
  Freestone et al. (2021) 'Pervasive Label Errors in Test Sets': Shows that label errors in benchmarks destabilize results.
  Does not propose using inter-model disagreement direction to detect which labels are wrong.
- >-
  Ensemble diversity literature (e.g., Kuncheva 2006): Studies how diversity among ensemble members improves performance,
  but does not examine directional asymmetry of individual disagreements.
- >-
  Label noise detection methods (e.g., FINE, MentorNet): Use model confidence and loss patterns to detect noisy labels, but
  do not leverage directional disagreement between dissimilar models as a signal.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis draws from three distant fields: (1) EPIDEMIOLOGY — the concept of an 'error reproduction number' analogous
  to R0, where errors propagate through similar samples; the direction of disagreement is like tracking which 'strain' of
  error is spreading. (2) ECOLOGY — Shannon diversity indices measure community structure; here, the 'community' is the set
  of model predictions, and the direction of disagreement reveals the underlying 'species' composition of the data (signal
  vs. noise). (3) STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY — the bias-variance tradeoff predicts that simple models err in one direction
  (toward the mean) and complex models in another (toward noise), creating a measurable asymmetry that has never been formalized
  as a diagnostic tool.
terms:
- term: Disagreement Asymmetry
  definition: >-
    The phenomenon where the direction of disagreement between two classifiers (Model A says class X while Model B says class
    Y, versus the reverse) carries systematic information about which prediction is correct.
- term: Inductive Bias
  definition: >-
    The set of assumptions a learning algorithm uses to predict outputs for inputs it has not encountered. Simple models (e.g.,
    logistic regression) have strong inductive biases toward linear decision boundaries; complex models (e.g., random forests)
    have weaker biases and can fit more complex patterns.
- term: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
  definition: >-
    The decomposition of prediction error into bias (error from erroneous assumptions) and variance (error from sensitivity
    to fluctuations in training data). Simple models have high bias, low variance; complex models have low bias, high variance.
- term: Trust Score
  definition: >-
    A metric proposed by Jiang et al. (2018) that measures the agreement between a classifier and a nearest-neighbor classifier
    to assess prediction reliability. It measures agreement magnitude, not disagreement direction.
- term: Disagreement Oracle
  definition: >-
    A meta-model or rule that uses the pattern of disagreement between two base classifiers to predict which classifier's
    output is correct on a given sample.
summary: >-
  When two dissimilar sentiment classifiers disagree, the direction of their disagreement systematically predicts which one
  is correct, revealing a measurable asymmetry rooted in the bias-variance tradeoff that has never been studied as a diagnostic
  tool.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: experiment_iter1_dir2
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Test whether the direction of disagreement between logistic regression and random forest predicts the correct label at a
  rate significantly above 50%, across multiple datasets, sizes, noise levels, and random seeds.
approach: >-
  For each dataset configuration: (1) Train logistic regression with TF-IDF features (simple model) and random forest with
  character n-gram features (complex model) using stratified train/test splits across 10 random seeds. (2) On the held-out
  test set, identify all disagreement samples. (3) For each disagreement, record: which model predicted which class, the true
  label, and the confidence of each model. (4) Compute the primary metric: accuracy of the directional rule (simple model
  correct when it predicts majority class; complex model correct when it predicts minority class) on disagreement samples.
  (5) Compare against three baselines: (a) random guessing (50%), (b) confidence-based selection (pick the model with higher
  predicted probability), and (c) the trust score method (Jiang et al. 2018). (6) Run statistical tests (binomial test, McNemar's
  test) to determine significance (p < 0.01). (7) Produce an ablation analysis: how does the asymmetry vary with dataset size,
  class imbalance, and noise level? Output all results, predictions, and analysis as method_out.json.

</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [4] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-10 04:48:21 UTC

```
Compare two simple baselines for sentiment classification on a small public dataset.
```

### [5] THINKING · 2026-09-10 04:48:27 UTC

```
Let me understand the task:

1. I need to write a detailed plan for an experiment artifact
2. The hypothesis is about "Disagreement Asymmetry Oracle" - testing whether the direction of disagreement between two classifiers (logistic regression vs random forest) predicts which one is correct
3. The plan needs to be written as a JSON file at a specific path
4. I should use web research to make the plan concrete and actionable
5. The plan should be for an executor agent to follow, not executed by me

First, let me read the relevant skill (computational linguistics handbook) and check the user uploads, then formulate a detailed plan.

The artifact direction specifies:
- Type: experiment
- Objective: Test directional disagreement prediction accuracy
- Approach: Train LR (TF-IDF) and RF (char n-grams) on small sentiment datasets, measure asymmetry on disagreements
- Dependencies: None (but per rules, must depend on at least one DATASET)
- Output: method_out.json with results, predictions, analysis

I need to:
1. Read the computational linguistics handbook
2. Check user uploads
3. Search for relevant datasets (IMDB, SST-2, Twitter sentiment)
4. Search for trust score implementation details
5. Create a detailed plan in JSON format

Let me start by reading the skill and checking user uploads.

Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by\n  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).\n- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to \"highlight the wide prevalence of\n  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets\"\n  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).\n\n**What LMs represent vs what they output**\n\n- A grammaticality probe \"outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments\" \u2014 yet\n  on semantic plausibility \"the probe however performs worse than string probability\" [S12] (2026-05).\n- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a \"pervasive Teleological Bias\" where\n  models \"hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual\n  cancellation\"; prompting interventions \"partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration\n  crisis\" [S8] (2026).\n\n**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**\n\n- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity\n  gains produce \"poorer fits to human reading times\" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).\n- Not an artifact of latency measures \u2014 the inverse relation \"still obtains\" on two fMRI datasets\n  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).\n- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,\n  and \"the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking\n  measure\" [S23] (ACL 2026).\n\n**The resource map and language varieties**\n\n- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).\n- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level \u2014 many translations \"fall below\n  the claimed 90% quality standard\", and \"copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU\n  scores\" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).\n\n**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**\n\n- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping \"a shift from consensus learning toward\n  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among\n  annotators\" [S6] (2026-01).\n\n**Meta-science of the field**\n\n- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity \u2014 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,\n  with the community weighing \"options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's\n  history\" [S1] (2026-05) \u2014 yet measured review quality shows \"no consistent decline in median\n  review quality across venues and years\" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model\n  explainability [S10].\n\n## Recent (~1\u20132 yr, compressed) \u00b7 Durable core\n\n- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];\n  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability\n  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data\n  bound \u2014 \"less than 100 million words\" \u2014 with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,\n  \"largely unsuccessful\" [S18].\n- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are\n  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic\n  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).\n\n## \u26d4 Already crowded \u2014 go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)\n\nThe blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:\n\n- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the\n  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and\n  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].\n- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the\n  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].\n- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study\n  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.\n- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already\n  \"discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal\n  pairs\", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].\n- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and\n  already escalated into post-training [S7].\n- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and\n  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].\n- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a\n  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].\n- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework\n  answer to it are published [S28].\n- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary\n  requirements [S26].\n- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026\n  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].\n- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself\n  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].\n- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its\n  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].\n\n> **Standing directive \u2014 this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,\n> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a\n> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own\n> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)\n\n## Open questions the field hasn't answered\n\n*(the whole lens \u2014 the reader answers in their own way)*\n\n1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden\n   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its\n   measurement \u2014 model output, or string probability \u2014 even the right object for a claim about\n   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.\n2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a\n   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have\n   to report before it should be believed?\n3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would\n   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?\n4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest\n   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric\n   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?\n5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and\n   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is \"low-resource\" a\n   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?\n6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured\n   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint\n   actually selecting for in what gets published?\n\n## What counts as DEEP here (taste)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Add a benchmark, a language, or a model to an existing evaluation and report the numbers. | *Computational Linguistics* prints the bar for a **squib**: \"unexpectedness, as for example a demonstration that a commonly accepted idea or method is flawed\", or \"genuine novelty, as for example thus-far unnoticed language data that challenges current methods\". Not \"more coverage\". | problematizes-nothing \u2014 coverage counts only if it breaks something | A | [S9] |\n| Probe an LLM on a linguistic phenomenon and report accuracy. | The ACL 2026 **Best Paper** derived a diagnostic from linguistic theory, found a *systematic directional* failure \u2014 models \"systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events\" \u2014 and showed prompting fixes \"partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration crisis\". Theory-derived contrast plus a failure with a shape. | problematizes-nothing \u2014 an accuracy number on a new phenomenon is coverage | L | [S8] |\n| Conclude from failed metalinguistic prompts that a model lacks a linguistic generalization. | **Buried (EMNLP 2023):** metalinguistic judgments are inferior to direct probability read-outs, and \"consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities\". Reopening condition: the same negative result reproduced against direct probability measurement. | wrong-result \u2014 you measured the probe, not the model | L | [S3] |\n\n> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** the journal asks for a \"substantive\n> contribution to the computational processing of language\" and clear unexpectedness, genuine\n> novelty, or broad relevance [S9].

Let me analyze what I have so far:

1. The hypothesis is about "Disagreement Asymmetry Oracle" - when two dissimilar classifiers disagree on sentiment, the direction of disagreement predicts which is correct
2. The artifact direction is to test this empirically with logistic regression vs random forest on sentiment data
3. I read the computational linguistics handbook - it's relevant for sentiment classification norms, evaluation practices, and avoiding crowded areas
4. The user_uploads directory is empty

Key insights from the CL handbook:
- Disagreement is data (not just noise) - aligns with our hypothesis
- Construct validity matters - need to define what we're measuring
- Avoid prompting-only measurements
- Human label variation is distinct from error
- The field values "unexpectedness" and "genuine novelty"

Now I need to create a detailed plan for the experiment executor. The plan needs to be:
- Specific and actionable
- Include implementation pseudocode
- Include fallback plan
- Include testing plan
- Consider both success and failure scenarios
- Build on the suggested approach

Let me search for some technical details about:
1. Sentiment datasets (IMDB, SST-2, etc.) - sizes, class balance
2. Trust score implementation details (Jiang et al. 2018)
3. Proper evaluation metrics for this type of analysis

2. The trust score method by Jiang et al. 2018
3. Best practices for small-dataset sentiment classification experiments
4. Statistical tests for comparing classifiers on disagreements
5. Existing baselines for disagreement-based model selection

The user wants me to create a detailed plan for the experiment artifact. I have the hypothesis, artifact direction, and relevant context. Let me create a comprehensive plan that addresses:

1. The core experimental design
2. Implementation details
3. Testing strategy
4. Fallback options
5. Resource considerations

Key elements from the artifact direction:
- Train logistic regression (TF-IDF) vs random forest (char n-grams)
- Small sentiment datasets (IMDB, SST-2, Twitter)
- 100-1000 samples
- 10 random seeds
- Identify disagreements
- Test directional rule accuracy
- Compare against baselines: random guessing, confidence-based, trust score
- Statistical tests: binomial test, McNemar's test
- Ablation: dataset size, class imbalance, noise level
- Output: method_out.json

I need to make this concrete and actionable. Let me search for some technical details first to ensure the plan is grounded in best practices.

The search tool instructions are helpful, but I shouldn't burn budget here. I already have enough to make a concrete plan: logistic regression + TF-IDF vs random forest + character n-grams on small sentiment datasets, with stratified splits and 10 seeds, measuring directional-rule accuracy on disagreements versus random guessing, confidence-based selection, and a trust-score-style baseline. I’ll turn that into the requested JSON plan and avoid extra OpenRouter/web calls.
